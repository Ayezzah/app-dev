# ‧₊˚ ☁️⋅♡𓂃 ࣪ ִֶָ☾. Themes I Love in Series and Movies

I am a girl who have a great love for series and movies that revolve around themes such as Greek mythology, detective mysteries, and literary inspirations. This is probably due to the fact that before I fell in love with TV series and movies, I was an avid reader of the same themes. In fact, I even finished the whole volume of books in relation to the said movies, since most of them are just adaptation of what I already read. With that, here's a glimpse into some of my favorite series and movies that embody these themes:
